#This is the todo list of the project

1. List elements to be included in the plateform
2. Datasets repository?
3. Agree on initial structure
4. How do we integrate the first bit 'Intro to Stata' and relate it to other resources (viz)?
5. How would the workflow happen before any module is validated and integrated?
6. Produce templates for modules including technical requirements (for a future webpage) and conceptual design
7. Some questions:
*What's the added value of such resource? Theory, content, methods and plateform
*Can it help bridging between qualitative and quantitative?
8. Next steps:
    * Add Ben as contributor to the git
    * List working environment options (tools: dillinger, atom, git desktop etc... )
    * Get familiar with git hub and tools
    * Sketch mapping of the future resource
    * Start thinking of an initial proof of concept:
        * Intro to Stata
        * Dataviz
        * Dataviz concepts
