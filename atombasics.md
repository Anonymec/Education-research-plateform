*This is a list of basic commands and stuff to using Atom. Most of what is discussed here is based on Atom Flight Manual https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/ which should be the goto page for anything you want to do in Atom. The corresponding Flight Manual link will be provided under each section if relevant*

https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/
This is one of the most important things you need to know as the power of Atom comes from its users' community and the numerous packages that they produce to make our lives easier.

Atom itself comes with a number of packages installed, and packages can pretty much change anything and everything in Atom.

To install a package open the Atom Settings tab (```Ctrl+,```) and click on Install (bottom left). In the search bar enter the name or part of the name of the package you are looking for, then press install.

Once your package is installed, it should be accessible under your packages tab.
